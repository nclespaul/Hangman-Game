The Hangman Game is a simple app where the user tries to guess a letter that the computer has picked.  The user gets nine guesses to get the correct answer, and each letter the user chooses is displayed in real time as the game progresses.  If the correct letter is guessed, the wins counter increments to reflect the win, and the game automatically restarts.  If the user doesn't guess the correct letter, the the losses column increments accordingly.
